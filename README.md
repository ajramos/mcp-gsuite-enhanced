## Install

### Option 1: Enhanced Version (Recommended) üöÄ

This enhanced version includes all the Google Meet fixes and improvements.

#### Cursor IDE Setup (Recommended)

For Cursor IDE users, use the setup helper script:

```bash
python cursor_setup.py
```

This will generate the correct MCP configuration and provide step-by-step instructions for adding it to your Cursor settings.

#### Manual Installation

You can install this enhanced version using uv (recommended):

```bash
# Clone and install from source (until published)
git clone https://github.com/ajramos/mcp-gsuite-enhanced
cd mcp-gsuite-enhanced
uv sync
```

Or with pip:

```bash
# Clone and install from source (until published)
git clone https://github.com/ajramos/mcp-gsuite-enhanced
cd mcp-gsuite-enhanced
pip install -e .
```

### Option 2: Original Version via Smithery üì¶

If you prefer the original version (without the Google Meet enhancements), you can install it via Smithery:

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install mcp-gsuite --client claude
```

**Note:** The original version has some limitations:
- ‚ùå Google Meet integration may not work reliably
- ‚ùå `update_calendar_event` functionality has known issues
- ‚ùå Attendee processing bugs

## Setup Google Authentication

### Google Cloud Configuration

You'll need to create a Google Cloud project and configure OAuth2 credentials:

#### Step 1: Create Google Cloud Project

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the required APIs:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" ‚Üí "Library"
   - Search for **"Gmail API"** and enable it
   - Search for **"Google Calendar API"** and enable it

#### Step 2: Setup OAuth 2.0 Credentials

1. Go to "APIs & Services" ‚Üí "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" ‚Üí "OAuth client ID"
3. Select **"Desktop application"** as the application type
4. Configure the OAuth consent screen if prompted
5. Download the credentials JSON file and save it as **`.gauth.json`** in your project directory

#### Step 3: Configure Your Google Accounts

Create a `.accounts.json` file in your project directory to specify which Google accounts to use:

```json
{
  "accounts": [
    {
      "email": "your-work@company.com",
      "account_type": "work",
      "extra_info": "Work account with company calendar"
    },
    {
      "email": "your-personal@gmail.com", 
      "account_type": "personal",
      "extra_info": "Personal account with family calendar"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Fields explanation:**
- **`email`**: Your Google account email address
- **`account_type`**: Category like "work", "personal", etc. (helps with organization)
- **`extra_info`**: Additional context that helps the AI understand this account's purpose

#### Step 4: Authenticate Your Google Accounts

Once you have both `.gauth.json` and `.accounts.json` files, run the authentication setup for each account:

```bash
python auth_setup.py your-work@company.com
python auth_setup.py your-personal@gmail.com
```

This script will automatically handle the OAuth flow and store your credentials securely in `.oauth2.{email}.json` files.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY WARNING**: Never commit credential files (`.gauth.json`, `.accounts.json`, `.oauth2.*.json`) to version control! Add them to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive authentication data.

### OAuth 2.0 Scopes (Automatic)

The server automatically requests these permissions - **no manual configuration needed**:

```json
[
  "openid",
  "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email",
  "https://mail.google.com/",
  "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar"
]
```

These scopes allow the server to:
- ‚úÖ Access your Gmail (read, send, manage drafts)
- ‚úÖ Manage your Google Calendar (create, update, delete events)
- ‚úÖ Create Google Meet links automatically
- ‚úÖ Identify your Google account

### Configuration Examples

#### Claude Desktop (Enhanced Version)

Add this to your Claude Desktop configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-gsuite-enhanced": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory", 
        "/path/to/mcp-gsuite-enhanced",
        "run",
        "mcp-gsuite-enhanced"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Claude Desktop (Original Version)

If you installed via Smithery, your configuration is automatically handled. Alternatively:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-gsuite": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-gsuite"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Using with uvx (Enhanced Version)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-gsuite-enhanced": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/mcp-gsuite-enhanced",
        "run",
        "mcp-gsuite-enhanced"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```



## Enhanced Google Meet Integration

The enhanced version automatically creates Google Meet links for new calendar events:

```json
{
  "calendar_id": "primary",
  "summary": "Team Standup",
  "start_time": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "end_time": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "attendees": "team@company.com,lead@company.com",
  "create_meet_link": true
}
```

Results in a calendar event with:
- ‚úÖ Automatic Google Meet link
- ‚úÖ Phone dial-in numbers
- ‚úÖ Meeting PIN
- ‚úÖ All attendees invited

## Development

To set up for development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajramos/mcp-gsuite-enhanced
cd mcp-gsuite-enhanced
uv sync
uv run mcp-gsuite-enhanced
```

### Debugging with MCP Inspector

Since MCP servers run over stdio, debugging can be challenging. For the best debugging experience, we strongly recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector).

You can launch the MCP Inspector via [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) with this command:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv --directory /path/to/mcp-gsuite-enhanced run mcp-gsuite-enhanced
```

Upon launching, the Inspector will display a URL that you can access in your browser to begin debugging.

#### Server Logs

You can also watch the server logs with this command:

```bash
# macOS
tail -n 20 -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-mcp-gsuite-enhanced.log

# Linux 
tail -n 20 -f ~/.config/Claude/logs/mcp-server-mcp-gsuite-enhanced.log

# Windows
Get-Content "$env:APPDATA\Claude\logs\mcp-server-mcp-gsuite-enhanced.log" -Wait -Tail 20
```

## Security

- All authentication is handled locally using OAuth 2.0
- Credentials are stored securely in local files
- No data is sent to third parties except Google's APIs
- Supports multiple Google accounts with isolated credentials
